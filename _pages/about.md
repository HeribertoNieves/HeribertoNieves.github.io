Hi, I’m Heriberto “Andy” Nieves, a Robotics Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, where I specialize in the intersection of **artificial intelligence and medical imaging**. My research is centered on using deep learning to automate quality control processes in magnetic resonance elastography, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnostic accuracy for conditions like liver fibrosis. My work has been [**published in 3 journal manuscripts and 4 conference articles**](/al-folio/publications/).

I’m fortunate to have received the **NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, along with the Goizueta, GT UCEM, and Atlanta ARCS Fellowships** at Georgia Tech. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering at Florida International University, graduating 1st in my class with a perfect **4.0 GPA**.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’ve had industry experience as a **Robotics R&D intern at Ethicon Endo-Surgery**, where I contributed to the software development of surgical robotics systems. I’m also passionate about mentoring, having guided undergraduate researchers through various projects in robotics and medical imaging, leading them to publish 1 journal mansucript and present at 3 conferences.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy Latin dancing, drawing, and unwinding with video games. My drive is to push the boundaries of AI in healthcare, while also making a positive impact through mentorship and leadership in STEM.
